#Web APIs Code Quiz - Flight of the Conchords Trivia

## Project status
Development for this project is on pause, for now.

## Description
A challenge for myself to build a quiz trivia page which will test my JavaScript skills. The page showcases a range of skills aquired to date, including alerts, local storage setting and getting, array organising, html targetting. The design of the quiz page is fairly basic aesthetically, but its vanilla appearance is formatted functionally for styles to be added and functionality has been prrioritised. It provides questions and button answers. Answers inform you if you are correct. High scores are collected in local storage and arranged in order of highest to lowest. As a web application in its own right, some of the CSS and html tools I have learned so far are also demonstrated on the main page.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
The title shows 'Flight of the Conchords' as the name of the page. The start page features a header with optional navigation to the high scores page in the top left corner, a blank timer in the top right corner, the title in the centre and a short description of how to play the quiz. Once the user clicks 'Start Quiz', the quiz begins, the timer begins, and the description and title are hidden. Questions read with 3 answers to choose from and if an incorrect answer is chosen, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. Once completed or the timer runs out, the user is switched again to a scores page where they can optionally input their initials and submit it with their score to a seperate high-scores page. On the high-scores page, they can find the top 10 scores (ranked) of theirs and of other local users. Two buttons offer to either return to the quiz start page to start again or to clear the high-scores table.


## Contributing
As this is a personal project, designed to challenge and test my skills, I am not currently looking for contributors. However, there may be a opening for this in the future.
